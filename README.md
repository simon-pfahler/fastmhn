# FastMHN - Fast inference of MHNs

This project aims to allow for the fast inference of MHNs through suitable rank-1 approximations of the time-marginalized probability distributions.

It is currently a work in progress.

## Getting started
The easiest way to use `fastmhn` is to clone the repository and install the package using `pip`.
This will automatically install the dependencies `numpy` and `mhn`.

The scripts `learn_approx_mhn.py` and `learn_approx_omhn.py` provide starting points for learning MHNs and oMHNs using this package.
